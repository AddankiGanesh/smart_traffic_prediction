# Traffic Congestion Detection 

## Usage
The system employs a machine learning model to classify traffic congestion levels (heavy/light) based on camera feed inputs. Using this information, the traffic lights are adjusted in real-time to improve the flow and reduce wait times at intersections.

## Features
- **Real-time Traffic Prediction**: Classifies traffic congestion as heavy or light using machine learning models.
- **Congestion Prediction**: Utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to predict traffic congestion as either heavy or light, achieving up to 90% accuracy.
- **Adaptive Traffic Signal Control**: Dynamically adjusts traffic signals based on real-time congestion.
- **Route Optimization**: Suggests alternative routes to avoid congestion and reduce travel time.
